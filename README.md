**Objective**
Guess the word before your man gets hung!

**Game play**
Press the "Start New Game" button and you will see the number of hyphens equal to the number of letters in the word. If a player selects a letter that appears in the word, the system fills in the blanks with that letter in the correct spots. If the word does not contain the suggested letter, the system will add a failed attempt. As the game progresses, the number of turns will continue to increase. You win the game by guessing the word before the turn counter reaches 10. Otherwise you will lose and the point will be given to the computer.
